# Memory Allocation Simulator

## Introduction

This is a Memory Allocation Simulator implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The simulator provides a visual representation of fixed memory allocation methods with equal or unequal partition sizes.

The simulator includes a modal that guides users through the steps of using the application. It explains the fixed partitioning process, the difference between equal and unequal size partitions, and how to allocate and deallocate processes.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The simulator will display a modal on the first visit, explaining the steps of fixed memory allocation.
3. Select either "Equal Size" or "Unequal Size" partitioning.
4. Enter the number of partitions (1 to 5) and the total memory size (55 or more).
5. Click the "Create Partitions" button to generate memory partitions.
6. Allocate processes by entering the process size and selecting a partition.
7. Optionally deallocate processes from partitions.

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the simulator.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the simulator.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for implementing simulator functionality.

## Modal

The modal provides essential information about the simulator's functionality, ensuring users understand the steps involved in fixed memory allocation.

## Important Notes

- The total memory size should be 55 or more, as 50 units are allocated for the OS.
- Ensure correct inputs for the number of partitions and memory size to avoid errors.
